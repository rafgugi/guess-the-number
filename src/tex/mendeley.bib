abstract = {This is a survey on searching with errors, considered in the framework of two-person games. The Responder thinks of an object in the search space, and the Questioner has to find it by asking questions to which the Responder provides answers, some of which are erroneous. We give a taxonomy of such games, depending on the type of questions allowed, on the degree of interactivity between the players, and on the imposed limitations on errors. We survey the existing results concerning such games, concentrating on the issue of optimizing the Questioner's querying strategy, and pointing out open problems. We show the relations between searching games with errors and problems concerning communication through a noisy channel and error-correcting codes. Finally, we discuss other search and computation problems with faulty feedback which are related to searching with errors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Permasalahan Ulam adalah permasalahan klasik yang dimulai pada tahun 1976. Permasalahan asli dari Permasalahan Ulam adalah permasalahan mencari banyak pertanyaan minimum untuk mencari sebuah bilangan dari 1 hingga 1.000.000, jika penjawab boleh berbohong paling banyak satu kali selama proses pencarian. Pada Tugas Akhir ini, akan dirancang penyelesaian permasalahan Ulam dalam pencarian bilangan pada rentang yang diberikan, dengan batasan maksimal rentang adalah 1018. Permasalahan ini dapat diselesaikan dengan menggunakan beberapa teori dan lemma, dan membuat 2 buah set, yaitu truth-set dan lie-set. Beberapa hal yang harus diperhatikan adalah mengenai cara mengatasi overflow dan mengatur elemen-elemen pada truth-set dan lie-set. Tipe data yang banyak digunakan pada permasalahan ini adalah long double dan long long, sedangkan struktur data yang digunakan untuk mengatur elemen pada truth-set maupun lie-set adalah struktur data set dengan tipe pair. Hasil dari tugas akhir ini telah berhasil menyelesaikan permasalahan di atas dengan cukup efisien, dengan rata-rata waktu penyelesaian 1.000 permainan dalam 0,17 detik dengan penggunaan memori 2,8 MB.},

@article{Ulrey1976,
abstract = {In this note we consider a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) where noiseless feedback is present. Shannon showed (Shannon, 1956) that the capacity of the DMC is not increased by feedback (in the case of block coding) by providing a weak converse. Later Kemperman and Kesten (unpublished) independently proved a strong converse. Kemperman's proof is published in (Wolfowitz, 1964, Chapter 4), and also in (Kemperman, 1971). Even though feedback has no effect on the value of the capacity of a memoryless channel in the case of block coding, it does, however, provide new possibilities for the actual construction of codes, as was shown in (Berlekamp, 1968) and (Ahlswede, 1971). A different approach to the problem is to try sequential coding, which Horstein did for the binary symmetric channel with feedback in (Horstein, 1963). The results of this note are (1) a weak converse for the DMC with feedback in the case of sequential coding, and (2) a counterexample to the strong converse. {\textcopyright} 1976 Academic Press, Inc.},

@article{Cicalese2000,
abstract = {Our aim is to minimize the number of answer/question alternations in a perfect two-fault-tolerant search. Ulam and R{\'{e}}nyi posed the problem of searching for an unknown m-bit number by asking the minimum number of yes-no questions, when up to ℓ of the answers may be erroneous/mendacious. Berlekamp considered the same problem in the context of error-correcting communication with feedback. Among others, he proved that at least qℓ(m) questions are necessary, where qℓ(m) is the smallest integer q satisfying 2q-m≥∑ℓj=0(qj). When all questions are asked in advance, and adaptiveness has no role, finding a perfect strategy (i.e., a strategy with qℓ(m) questions) amounts to finding an ℓ-error-correcting code with 2mcodewords of length qℓ(m). From coding theory it is known that such perfect non-adaptive searching strategies are rather the exception, for ℓ≥2. At the other extreme, in a fully adaptive search, where the (t+1)th question is asked knowing the answer to the tth question, perfect strategies are known to exist for all sufficiently large m. What happens if we impose restrictions on the amount of adaptiveness avaliable to the questioner? Focusing attention on the case ℓ=2, we shall prove that, for each m≠2, perfect searching strategies still exist even if the questioner is allowed to adapt his strategy only once. All our results are constructive and explicitly yield perfect two-error-correcting codes with the least possible feedback. We finally generalize our results to k-ary search. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},
